# For First Evalution
To start off with the front end coding for the website, we drew a wireframe keeping in mind all the required fields and content we wanted to show. The wireframe hence attached in the repository is the wireframe of our Homepage. It contains a basic layout of how the website content is going to be arranged once the coding is done.
Then we drew up a basic layout using HTML where we wrote down a basic code to go up on the site. 
Then we added in some CSS to make the basic layout more clearer.
Also, We made a logo suited for the type of website we are planning to make.
Then the some more content was added such as the popular books and the classics.
